== u2flib-server-demo
A simple self-contained demo server.

=== Usage
Compile using `mvn clean install` and then run using
`java -jar target/java-u2flib-server-demo.jar server config.yml`.

The demo server is configured to use _example.com:8080_ as _AppID_.
This mean that you must add the following to your hosts file:

```
127.0.0.1 example.com
```

Then point a U2F-compatible web browser (e.g. Chrome) to
link:http://example.com:8080/startRegistration[example.com:8080/startRegistration].
