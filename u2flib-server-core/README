public static StartedRegistration startRegistration(String appId);

/**
* Finishes a previously started registration.
*
* @param startedRegistration
* @param tokenResponse the response from the token/client.
* @return a Device object, holding information about the registered device. Servers should
* persist this.
*/
public static Device finishRegistration(
	StartedRegistration startedRegistration,
	RegistrationResponse tokenResponse
) throws U2fException;

/**
* Initiates the authentication process.

* the server.
*/
public static StartedAuthentication startAuthentication(String appId, Device device);

/**
